# GDP_Analysis

GDP Analysis of Indain States on below points- 

 - Which states have been growing consistently fast, and which ones have been struggling?
 - What has been the average growth rate of your home state, and how does it compare to the national average over this duration?
 - Identified the top 5 and the bottom 5 states based on total GDP.
 - Identified the top 5 and the bottom 5 states based on the GDP per capita.
 - Found the ratio of the highest per capita GDP to the lowest per capita GDP.
 - Categorised the states into four groups based on the GDP per capita (C1, C2, C3, C4, where C1 would have the highest per capita GDP and C4, the lowest). The        quantile values are (0.20,0.5, 0.85, 1), i.e., the states lying between the 85th and the 100th percentile are in C1; those between the 50th and the 85th            percentiles are in C2, and so on.
 - Found the top 3/4/5 sub-sectors (such as agriculture, forestry and fishing, crops, manufacturing etc., not primary, secondary and tertiary) that contribute to      approximately 80% of the GSDP of each category.
